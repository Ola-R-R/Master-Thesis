\noindent In this thesis, I analyze the Norwegian zero-coupon yield data and implement the \textbf{Heath, Jarrow \& Morton} (HJM) forward rate model to this dataset. This is done by using \textbf{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) to extract the most important movements of the yields, also called interest rates. I propose different methods that can simulate the entire yield curve by using the HJM forward rate model and the \textbf{Nelson Siegel} (NS) model. The methods are evaluated using a cross-validation method called \textbf{Leave-Group-Out Cross-validation} (LGOCV) because this method works well with time series data. In addition, I use these simulations to get the fair value of interest rate derivatives and look into the financial risk associated with these derivatives. I find that my implementation of the HJM forward rate model is correct by investigating my model assumptions, and by looking at the cross-validation scores of the different methods I find that two of my methods work better than the others.
